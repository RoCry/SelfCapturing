## What is this? How to use it?

It is a mac app which could do:  
1.	After you launched it, it will automatic turn on camera @8:00am and turn off camera @8:00pm, record one frame every 5 second, this will end up with a .mov file at ~/Desktop/SelfCapturing/xxxxx.mov(Of course you could turn it on and off  manually)  
2.	nothing more...
